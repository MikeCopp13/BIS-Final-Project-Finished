                    I said, I don't know your name but I'm gonna know it by the end of the night.<br />

            <div class="song_body">
                <p>
                    I said sometimes when I close my eyes I think I'm you instead.<br />
                    So please don't compromise these thoughts as they cross right through your head.<br />
                    You see times I would think; I would question everything.<br />
                    But this time, I'm really done thinking; I'm really done questioning. Done Questioning.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Cuz most times I just say, let it go; let her go.<br />
                    But this time I try to say yeah but I really said no. Just say no.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's easier said than done but what's already been said is already gone.<br />
                    My words will make you think faster than your thoughts can comprehend.<br />
                    So we said how could we let this one pass?<br />
                    Did I really let it go, let her go?<br />
                    Cuz most times I say yeah but this time I just said no.<br />
                    I just gotta know one thing – stop! What you doin?<br />
                    I know this shit don't mean a thing<br />
                    but trust me when I say I'm done choosing and I'm done questioning (done).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cuz most times I just say, let it go; let her go.<br />
                    But this time I try to say yeah but I really said no. Just say no.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Say when the lights dim down can we take this back to my place?<br />
                    Do you remember those times when I didn't even know your name?<br />
                    Said we would sit across the room; I would think of something funny to say to you.<br />
                    But when the lights dim down, I just want to see your face.<br />
                    And when the lights turn on, I've never really seen your face.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cuz most times I just say, let it go; let her go.<br />
                    But this time I try to say yeah but I really said no. Just say no.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Just say – Just say – Just say no. Just say no.
